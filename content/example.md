# This is an h1 header. 

## I can also create h2 headers like this one.

Here is some random paragraph text. Here is more paragraph text. Is this the best blog you've ever read? Probably not yet, but maybe someday. If you're someone who likes to read filler nonsense, then this might be the best blog you've read. If you are this kind of person, you will not like my other blog posts, because they are complete non-nonsense. Or at least they will be, because I will delete this post when I make those other, future **amazing** posts.

If you are this kind of person, you will not like my other blog posts, because they are complete non-nonsense.

### Here is an h3 header

Here is some random paragraph text. Here is more paragraph text. Is this the best blog you've ever read? Probably not yet, but maybe someday. If you're someone who likes to read filler nonsense, then this might be the best blog you've read. If you are this kind of person, you will not like my other blog posts, because they are complete non-nonsense. Or at least they will be, because I will delete this post when I make those other, future amazing posts. 

## I can also create code blocks

~~~js
const test = () => {
  return "This is a test!";
}

console.log(test());

const countBy2 = (max) => {
  console.log("This is just random javascript code. Counting by 2...");
  for (let i = 0; i <= max; i += 2) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
countBy2();
//This is random nonsense code. I guess it fits the theme
~~~

## I can also make lists

If you're someone who likes to read filler nonsense, then this might be the best blog you've read. If you are this kind of person, you will like my other blog posts, because they are complete non-nonsense. Or at least they will be, because I will delete this post when I make those other, future amazing posts. Here is a list:
1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three
4. Item four
5. Item five
6. Item seven. Just kidding.
