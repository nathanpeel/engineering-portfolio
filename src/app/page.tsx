        <h2>More about me</h2>
        <p>
          I have many interests and hobbies such as hiking, reading fiction,
          manga, anime, visiting the San Diego Zoo and Birch Aquarium,
          philosophy, meditation, and learning to better understand the people
          and world around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a huge fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Regarding manga, so
          far I have read Monster by Naoki Urasawa, Berserk by Kentaro Miura,
          and I am now reading Vagaond by Takehiko Inoue. I had my own
          expereince with story writing when I wrote my book{" "}
          <em>The Cards That Are Dealt</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am constantly trying to grow and learn, both in my profession and
          outside it. I am currently on a weight-loss and fitness journey. I am
          also learning how to be more present and mindful using meditation. I
          study many subjects such as philosophy, history, psychology, and
          religion to better understand myself and the people around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also play violin (though not as much lately). As mentioned, I am a
          author and writer, with plans to write many more books.
