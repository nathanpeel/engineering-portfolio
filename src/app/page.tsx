          <p>
            I have many interests and hobbies such as hiking, reading fiction,
            manga, anime, visiting the San Diego Zoo and Birch Aquarium,
            philosophy, meditation, and learning to better understand the people
            and world around me.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Avatar: The Last Airbender is my favorite show. Regarding manga, so
            far I have read Monster by Naoki Urasawa, Berserk by Kentaro Miura,
            and I am now reading Vagaond by Takehiko Inoue. I had my own
            expereince with story writing when I wrote my book{" "}
            <em>The Cards That Are Dealt</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I strive for constant growth and learning, both in my profession and
            outside it. I am currently on a weight-loss and fitness journey. I
            am also learning how to be more present and mindful using
            meditation. I study many subjects such as philosophy, history,
            psychology, and religion to better understand myself and the people
            around me.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I also play violin (though not as much lately). As mentioned, I am a
            author and writer, with plans to write many more books.
