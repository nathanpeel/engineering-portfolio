This is my software engineer portfolio and blog. It is very much still in progress, but the main information is there. 
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwindcss
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Animation**: Framer Motion

## Pages

There are three pages, the home page, the blog page, and the work page. The home page is divided into components. The blog page has dynamic routing. 

## Blog

Note that all of the current blog posts are nonsense for testing. Eventually, the blog will focus on software engineering while incorporating philosophy. Stay tuned for updates.

## Next steps

- Finish breaking down the home page into smaller components and adding styling
- Style blog page
- Style dynamic blog post page
- Add content to work page
- Style work page
- Add interactive on hover and onclick styling
- Potentially add background 3D objects for intrigue
