## Pages

There are three pages, the home page, the blog page, and the work page. The home page is divided into components. The blog page has dynamic routing. 

## Blog

Note that all of the current blog posts are for testing/demonstration. Eventually, the blog will focus on software engineering while incorporating philosophy. Stay tuned for updates.

## Next steps
